# CS 157A Notes and Confessions

## Notes

    The documentation for running the files can be read on the header for the provided BankingSystem and p2 java/sql files.

    All files submitted are required to run the CLI, in addition to other basic dependencies described in the p1/p2 project specification documents, but the p2 sql file can be run and tested independently.

## Confessions

    Some modifications were made to account for the previous errors made in p1 CLI.
    The CLI should no longer allow the following to occur:
    - id number is not displayed when user is created;
    - withdraw from account not owned by user;
    - transfer from someone else's account to user's account;
    - close account that is not user's;

    Otherwise, the CLI is pretty much the same in terms of the logic/experience of that made for P1.

To whoever is grading, best of luck on your finals/endeavors. Also tell Prof Butt I said hi.
