## Confessions
    I had experienced technical difficulties on my container within my Desktop PC. I ran a reinstall of the db2 image and container but the installation was not behaving as expected, which then impeded on my ability to debug and test the project. This is the reason why I submitted the work one day late, and mentioned this to Professor Butt.

    I got this running on my laptop, which I had used for previous homeworks with no problems.
